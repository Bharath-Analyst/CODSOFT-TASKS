**TASK 3: IRIS FLOWER CLASSFICATION**

Aim:
This project seeks to create a model capable of categorizing iris flowers into distinct species by analyzing their sepal and petal measurements.

**TASK 5: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION**

Aim:
Create a machine learning model with the goal of identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. Preprocess and normalize data, address class imbalances, and split the dataset. Train a classification algorithm, evaluate performance using precision, recall, and F1-score, and explore oversampling or undersampling techniques to improve results. The aim is to enhance the accuracy of detecting fraudulent transactions.\
